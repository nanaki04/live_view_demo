# Space Birds

This is my entry in [Phoenix Phrenzy](https://phoenixphrenzy.com), showing off what [Phoenix](https://phoenixframework.org/) and [LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view) can do.

Space birds is an action packed multiplayer top down sci-fi shooter game, to test the limits of [Phoenix Live View](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view), and of course, have a lot of fun while doing so!

The game can be played [here](https://space-birds.herokuapp.com/space_birds).
